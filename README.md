## Overview

Itch.io page can be found [here](https://chyrro.itch.io/enigma).

This short enigma was made during the 105th edition of the Weekly Game Jam, which theme was "Cheat To Win" (from July 12th 2019 to July 18th 2019)..

Sadly, I only had two days available to work on it, but the game is still playable and can be finished.
